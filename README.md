# AirBnb-Berlin-Analysis_2009-2019
Python code and all important informations to analyse data on AirBnB reviews/ratings. Analysing the data to look for possible patterns to predict if a listing is good or bad based on factors, we have control over while booking an accomodation. 

## Objective
I like to use AirBnB to find accomodation for my holidays. In this analysis, I aim to investigate the connections between ratings and various other attributes. By exploring these relationships, I want to gain a deeper understanding of key factors that contribute to positive ratings and ultimately enhance my ability to identify accomodations that are likely to recieve a good rating and are therefore a good stay.

## Data 
The data is sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w25)
The dataset contains reviews from June 2009 to May 2019, together with informations about the listing like Price, geographical data and all necessary informations about the listing.
